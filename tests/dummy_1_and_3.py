"""
Running dummy command defined in app1 (subclass of NoArgsCommand) and app3
(subclass of LabelCommand), demonstrating incompatibilities

Calling the 'dummy' command without args will fail when app1 is first in
INSTALLED_APPS. app1 command's handle method is indeed not called because
of MRO (the command class' bases are (app3.Command, app1.Command)). Calling it
with args will only call the command defined in app3.

Calling the 'dummy' command with args will fail when app3 is first in
INSTALLED_APPS. app3 command's handle method is indeed not called because of
MRO (the final command class' bases are (app1.Command, app3.Command)). Calling
it without args will only call the command defined in app1.

Calling the 'dummy' command with app1 and app3 in INSTALLED_APPS should raise
a warning.

This behavior should be changed in future versions. Overriding a command with
different base classes should not be possible (and actually should never
happen).
